# CRISPR_ML_PAPERS_LIST

Nucleic Acid-Based Research (CRISPR ,miRNA, primers) ML/DL Papers Repository
This repository contains a comprehensive list of all papers cited and discussed in Section 3  of our paper "The Evolution of Nucleic Acid–Based Diagnosis Methods from the (pre-)CRISPR to CRISPR era and the Associated Machine/Deep Learning Approaches in Relevant RNA Design" (https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-0716-4079-1_17).

The collection covers computational approaches for:

Primer Design
miRNA-Target Predictions
CRISPR Applications:

  On-Target Activity
  Off-Target Activity
  Prime and Base Editing
  Cas9-Induced Editing Profile Predictions


Additionally, we've included all CRISPR tools (list of papers )  from Table 3 of our paper.
